# Auto_EDA_plots
# ðŸ“Š Automated Exploratory Data Analysis and Plot Storage Tool

This project is a no-code web application that performs automatic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and stores generated visualizations in a database for future use.

The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, a Python framework designed for creating interactive web apps with minimal effort. It provides built-in components like file uploaders and widgets, allowing users to interactively explore data without writing any code.

The backend uses **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Plotly** for creating dynamic and interactive graphs, and **SQLite** to store generated plots as images. Users can upload datasets in various formats (CSV, Excel, SQLite), generate different types of plots (line, bar, pie, scatter, histogram, etc.), and save them automatically.

This tool is especially useful for non-technical users who need quick insights from data but lack programming experience. It simplifies the decision-making process by enabling easy data exploration through a clean, intuitive interface.

Overall, this project bridges the gap between raw data and decision-making by making EDA accessible, fast, and persistent â€” all through a web browser.
